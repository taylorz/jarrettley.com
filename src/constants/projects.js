        title: "The Near Death of Zaoura",
        text: "Occupied by Israel since 1967, Zaoura is an Arab village in the Golan Heights used by the IDF as a military training ground for urban warfare. The IDF extracts the urban and architectural syntax of Zaoura as military knowledge and rehearses its weaponization into the medium of warfare itself, simulating the defeat of future Arab enemies through the domination of its architectures and cities. If urbicide is the killing of a city, enacted through the destruction of its vital infrastructures and buildings, then the IDF has subjected Zaoura to a near death experience, keeping its fragments alive just enough to enact a slow ruination by bullet and munition. Israel’s militarized-architecture regime operates over Zaoura in concert with an aesthetic regime of spectacle and performance. As sites of living memory for Syrian villagers, who have been banned from living in the town since 1967, the half-dead ruins of Zaoura are mechanized by the IDF not just as training centers, but also as staging grounds for the spectacular political performance of Israeli dominance over Arab architecture and cultural memory.",

        title: "A Politics of Dissassembly: Al Qaeda in Iraq",
        text: "Under the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Al Qaeda in Iraq applied the organization’s institutionalized paramilitary practices to an extensive campaign of unconventional urban warfare aimed at Iraqi Shi’ite civilians. The targeting of Shi’ite civilians marked a new formation of Al Qaeda doctrine, as Zarqawi posited their destruction as a strategic maneuver intended to provoke retaliation from Sunnis and thus induce destabilizing sectarianism. Al Qaeda in Iraq’s coordinated car bombings weaponized buildings, vehicles, and infrastructure against their targets, redesigning U.S. Coalition occupied Baghdad into technologies for the production of somatic and architectural carnage. These operations were carried out in coordination with the newly formed Al Qaeda in Iraq Media Department which recorded, spliced, and broadcasted its violence in a series of videos distributed through online media networks. A Politics of Disassembly examines Al Qaeda in Iraq’s car bombing campaign as part of an expanded apparatus of architectural and mediatic production in which Iraqi civilians were entered into a destabilizing secretion death economy. The text traces the epistemologies of secret intelligence as they are produced in the organization’s site surveillance strategies to the arenas of contingency which they structure on Baghdad’s highways, revealing these as a governing conditions for the production of death in which Al Qaeda in Iraq’s necropolitical subjects operate as cartographic agents of sectarian divide. Alongside the text, the book archives the historical records of Al Qaeda in Iraq for their embeddedness within the U.S. counter-terrorism apparatus. The redactions, translations, pixilation, and time codes of these key documents and media records are organized as structuring conditions of its spatial politics.",

        title: "Evidencing Life",
        text: "Evidencing Life considers the strategies used by China and the Philippines, two of the six claimants in the dispute over the South China Sea, in the northwest Spratly Islands where the Philippines have established a small civilian population on Thitu Island in response to China’s construction of an artificial island on nearby Subi Reef. Tracing a moral and political continuum from the precarity of civilian life against the hard power of military technology, to the soft power of ecocide within the coral reef environments upon which civilians depend, the project speculates on architecture’s capacity to evidence life as a mode of resistance within these systems of violence. Thitu Reef has been devastated by ecocide administered through the highly destructive operation of reef cutting used by Chinese fisherman to extract giant clams from the reef floor. Fishermen apply propeller blades against the coral floor, rotating the boat in a lateral motion, destroying the coral environments, its ability to maintain calcification, and sustain the biodiversity upon which the Philippines depends for economic vitality. This pernicious operationalization of global ecology has scarred over 25 square miles of coral reef, leaving behind thousands of semi-circular scars still visible in satellite imagery. The damage is exacerbated by the related practice of dredging the reefs to construct militarized artificial islands. As acknowledged in a 2015 decision handed down by the international tribunal in the Hague, the damage done to the environment is not contained to the immediate sites of reclamation and coral scaring, but extends to the whole reef ecology. These activities released sedimentation and nutrients that interfere with the vitality of coral reefs surrounding Thitu island and others. Understood as a violation of UNCLOS environmental laws which establish the health of shared environments such as the South China Sea as the collective responsibility of all neighboring states, these events evidence the power of a violence which transcends the political boundaries of actors, and coalesces in indiscreet moments on the volatile biological substrates that sustain economies and ecosystems alike. The proposed coral restoration infrastructure responds to the slow violence of ecocide administered outside its political borders but targeted at it’s internal vitality by evidencing its damage, remediating its impacts, and countering its indiscriminate territorial impacts with an architecture that circulates human bodies around its ecological edge. The reef infrastructure is programmed with above and below water programs for civilian scuba diving, each of which ensures their visibility within aerial drone vision above and sonar below. This is intertwined with a drone port that extends the scope of existing surveillance infrastructures.",
